CampusHelper
============

We plan on having only two more branches, one for front-end and one for back-end.

*** FOR NICK ***
1) Clone the repository for CampusHelper
2) Connect your local repo to the remote, so you can push, pull, etc
3) Give Anand your heroku email, so he can add you as a collaborator as well
4) Run " heroku git:remote -a campushelper " in order to connect your local git repo to heroku's.
***
In order to push to github:
	git push origin <branch>

***
In order to push to Heroku:
	git push heroku <branch>

*** 
In order to simulate Heroku locally: RUN
	foreman start
in the same directory as the Procfile
